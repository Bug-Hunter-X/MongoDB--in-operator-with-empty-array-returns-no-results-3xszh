# MongoDB $in operator with empty array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when provided with an empty array.  The issue arises when attempting to query documents where a field's value should be present in an empty array, which unexpectedly returns no results. The solution involves using alternative approaches such as `$exists` to handle scenarios where the target array is potentially empty.
